This project is about Wedgewood  Pacific (WP) company, which manufactures and sells consumer drones. We will build the database for WP. 

The Wedgewood Pacific (WP) company, founded in 1957 in Seattle, Washington, manufactures and sells consumer drone aircraft. This is an innovative and rapidly developing 
market. In January, 2016, the FAA said that 181,000 drones (out of the approximately 700,000 drones that may have been sold during the 2015 Christmas season) had been registered under the new FAA drone registration rules.
